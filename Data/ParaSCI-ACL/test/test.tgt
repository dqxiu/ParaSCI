to predict labels , we train conditional random fields , which are directly optimized for splitting .
in this work , we develop neural models in a sequential way , and encode sentence semantics and their relations automatically .
on a set of manually annotated verbal readings , we found that our lexicon provided enough information to reliably predict the aspectual value of verbs across their readings .
that consists of two parts : multi-channel cnn and lstm .
kendall ’ s math-w-2-5-2-97 as a performance measure for evaluating the output of information-ordering components .
in this work , we assume the general connotation of each word over statistically prevailing senses .
with this result , we further show that these paraphrases can be used to obtain high precision surface patterns .
one uses confusion network decoding to combine translation systems as described in and .
cnn is a neural network that can make use of the internal structure of data such as the 2d structure of image data through convolution layers , where each computation unit responds to a small region of input data ( e.g. , a small square of a large image ) .
englishgerman , english-french and chinese-to-english translation tasks .
our macro f1 score were 32 . 73 % and 17 . 98 % for our english data and spanish data .
to be able to recognize non-continuous entities , an sbieon encoding was used .
this approach is similar to previous structure learning modelings for dependency parsing .
we also extract subject-verbobject event representations , using the stanford partof-speech tagger and maltparser .
however , the ensemble system is able to effectively leverage this higher prediction , producing a prediction of 1 . 76 , which is the most accurate .
zhang and clark proposed a word-based model using perceptron .
the language model is trained and applied with the srilm toolkit .
